        <p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For other uses, see Billionaire (disambiguation).</i></p>
        <p>A <strong>billionaire</strong>is a person with a net worth of at least one billion (1,000,000,000, i.e., a
            thousand million) units of a given currency, usually of a major currency such as the United States dollar,
            euro, or pound sterling. It is a sub category of ultra high-net-worth individual. The American business
            magazine Forbes produces a global list of known U.S. dollar billionaires every year and updates an Internet
            version of this list in real-time.<sup>[1]</sup>. The American oil magnate John D. Rockefeller became the
            world's first confirmed U.S. dollar billionaire in 1916.
            <br>
            <br>
            As of 2018, there are over 2,200 U.S. dollar billionaires worldwide, with a combined wealth of over US$ 9.1
            trillion,<sup>[3]</sup> up from US$7.67 trillion in 2017.<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[5]</sup> According to a 2017
            Oxfam report, the top eight richest billionaires own as much combined wealth as "half the human
            race".<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> As of 2021, eight people have reached the status of USD
            hectobillionaires, meaning that each has had a net worth of at least $100 billion.[8]</p>

        <p>
            According to the UBS/PwC Billionaires Report 2019 report released in November 2019, there are currently
            2,101
            U.S. dollar billionaires worldwide, from 66 countries, with a combined net worth of $8.5 trillion.[9][10]
            Also according to the report, billionaires have a substantial positive impact on the sustainability and
            success of companies controlled by them. Billionaire-controlled companies listed on the equity market
            returned 17.8 percent, compared with the 9.1 percent of the MSCI AC World Index. According to the authors of
            the report, this Billionaire Effect is connected with smart risk-taking and willingness to plan and invest
            for the long term.
            <br><br>
            The majority of billionaires are male, as fewer than 11% (197 of 1,826) on the 2015 list were female
            billionaires.[11] The United States has the largest number of billionaires of any country, with 536 as of
            2015,[11] while China, India and Russia are home to 213, 90 and 88 billionaires, respectively.[12][13] As of
            2015, only 46 billionaires were under the age of 40,[11] while the list of American-only billionaires, as of
            2010, had an average age of 66.[14]

            Different authorities use different methodologies to determine net worth and to rank them, and not all
            information about personal finances is publicly available. In 2019,
            Forbes counted a record 607 billionaires in the U.S..[15] Over the course of the 2020s, depending on the
            source and the year, the world's richest person has been reckoned to be Jeff Bezos, Bernard Arnault and
            family, or Elon Musk.

        <h2>Education and work experience</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Billionaires come from a very wide number of backgrounds. A review of the education and work histories of the
            top 400 billionaires shows little correlation between education and success. Nearly 30% of billionaires do
            not have a college degree, greatly exceeding any other educational background. The most common field of
            university education was finance and economics, which only contributed to a combined 15.5% of billionaire
            educations.[16][17] There is little correlation between any university and becoming a billionaire. The top
            10 Universities produced just 99 of the top 400 billionaires combined, significantly less than the total
            number of billionaires who were not college educated. Military service produced 21 billionaires, more than
            any single University.[17]
            <br><br>
            Very few college-educated billionaires pursued business interests in their field of study, with the
            exception of computer science majors. All twelve of the twelve computer science major billionaires worked in
            computer science, while only half of Engineers worked in Engineering, and less than a quarter of finance and
            economics majors ever worked in finance or economics. The most common field for billionaires to enter was
            sales and military service.[17]</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See also: Ultra high-net-worth individual</p>
        <p>ccording to a 2016 Oxfam report, the wealth of the poorest 95% dropped by 38% between 2010 and 2015, due to
            an increase in the global population of 400 million.[18] In the same period, the wealth of the richest 62
            people between the World's Billionaires increased by $500bn (£350bn) to $1.76tn. More recently, in 2017 an
            Oxfam report noted that just eight billionaires have as much net worth as "half the human race".[6][7]
            However, the Oxfam report has been criticized for considering debt as negative wealth, which leads to
            wealthy people with large amounts of debt to be considered poor or not wealthy.[19]</p>

        <h2>Rise of new billionaires</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>In 2019, 19 people became billionaires. Four were a result of death or divorce, including Julia Koch, and
            Jeff Bezos's former wife MacKenzie Scott.[20]
            <br>
            In the last five years,[when?] the number of female billionaires has grown by 46 percent, that is more than
            the number of male billionaires in the same period (39 percent). As of 2019 there were 233 female
            billionaires in the world, compared to 160 in 2013.[9]</p>
